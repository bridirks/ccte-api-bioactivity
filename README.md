# Bioactivity Microservice (ccte-api-bioactivity)

## Overview
The Bioactivity Microservice is a RESTful API designed to manage and provide bioactivity data. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database and offers various endpoints for bioactivity-related operations.

## Available Data
Data underlying the Bioactivity API comes from ToxCast’s invitrodb. US EPA’s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program makes medium- and high-throughput bioactivity screening assay data publicly available for prioritization and hazard characterization.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for the development of the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Part of the Spring Data family, used to simplify data access and persistence.
- **Spring Data REST**: Used to expose Spring Data repositories as RESTful web services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for storing bioactivity data.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.
- **Lombok**: Java library used to reduce boilerplate code.
- **MapStruct**: Code generator used to simplify the implementation of mappings between Java bean types.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for API documentation and testing.
- **Testcontainers**: Java library used for integration testing with Docker containers.

## Configuration
The application configuration is managed through YAML files. The main configuration file is `application.yml`, and environment-specific configurations are in files like `application-local.yml`.

## Build and Deployment
The project uses Maven for build and deployment processes. Continuous integration and deployment can be set up using tools like GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started
To build and run the project locally, use the following Maven commands:

```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
